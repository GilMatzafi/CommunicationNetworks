# UDP DNS Service

This project, named "UDP DNS Service", implements a DNS-like service using the UDP protocol. The goal of this project is to create a server that can map domain names to IP addresses. The server "learns" new mappings from a parent server if it encounters unknown domains, thus enhancing its capabilities over time.
