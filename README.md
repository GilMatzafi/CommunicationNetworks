# 🌐 Communication Networks Projects

This repository contains two projects developed as part of my communication networks course at Bar-Ilan University:

- 📡 [**UDP DNS Exercise**](./UDP_DNS_Service): Simulates a DNS-like service over UDP, where a server maps domain names to IP addresses and learns new mappings from a parent server for future queries.

- 🔄 [**UDP Protocol Exercise**](./UDP_Protocol): Demonstrates a basic client-server model using UDP, where the client sends a message to the server, and the server responds with a processed message.

These projects showcase practical applications of UDP communication and key concepts from my coursework.
